Enhancing Sentiment Analysis 
Developed an advanced machine learning model aimed at detecting fake reviews by integrating multiple analytical approaches, 
including sentiment analysis and readability metrics.
 Utilized Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification to effectively distinguish between genuine and fraudulent reviews, ensuring high 
accuracy and reliability in predictions.
 Implemented various features in the model, including:
 • RoBERTa embeddings: Leveraged the power of deep learning through the RoBERTa model to capture contextual nuances in 
textual data.
 • VADER sentiment scoring: Employed the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) tool to analyze 
sentiment polarity and intensity within reviews, enhancing emotional context understanding.
 • Readability indices: Incorporated metrics such as the SMOG Index, Flesch Reading Ease, and Gunning Fog Index to evaluate 
the complexity of the language used in reviews, contributing to a holistic detection strategy
 Conducted thorough data preprocessing, including text normalization, emoji extraction, and sentiment scoring based on a sentiment 
dictionary, which enriched the model's feature set. Achieved a significant improvement in classification accuracy by fusing sentiment 
scores derived from emojis with traditional textual features, thus enhancing the model's capability to capture subtle patterns 
indicative of fake reviews.
